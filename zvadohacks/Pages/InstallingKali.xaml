                <Image Source="s3.png"></Image>
                <Label>Once through the local information, the loader will automatically install some additional components and configure your network related settings. Then the installer will prompt for a hostname and domain for this installation. Provide appropriate information for the environment and continue installing.</Label>

                <Label>After the password is set, the installer will prompt you to set the time zone and then pauses at the disk partitioning. The installer will now provide you four choices about the partitions of the disk. The easiest option for you is to use ‘Guided – Use Entire Disk’. Experienced users can use the “Manual” partitioning method for more granular configuration options.</Label>
